# Tunnel Fee Calculator

The Tunnel Fee Calculator is a modern, responsive web application that calculates toll fees for crossing the Blackwall and Silvertown Tunnels. It features a live countdown timer until charges come into effect (from **7 April 2025**), dynamic fee calculation based on peak and off-peak periods, and an interactive map image popup for full-size viewing.

## Features

- **Live Countdown Timer:**  
  Displays the remaining time until charges become effective on 7 April 2025. Once the target date is reached, the timer updates with a friendly message.

- **Responsive Design:**  
  The layout adapts gracefully to mobile, tablet, and desktop screens. On wider viewports, the calculator appears alongside a detailed map image.

- **Fee Calculation:**  
  Input the day, time (in HH:MM format), and vehicle type to calculate the applicable toll fee. The logic distinguishes between peak and off-peak periods.

- **Instruction & Fee Schedule Modal:**  
  Click the small question mark button to open a modal with clear instructions and a complete fee schedule.

- **Full-Size Map Popup:**  
  Clicking on the map image opens a modal displaying the full-size map of the tunnels. The image scales responsively to ensure the full map is always visible.
